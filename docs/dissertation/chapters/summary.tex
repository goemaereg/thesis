\chapter*{Summary}

The Weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) task has gained popularity because it can be used to localize objects in images using network models trained with image-level labels only. The class activation mapping (CAM) family of WSOL methods focus on different strategies to successfully cover and localize object in images. As these CAM-based methods often use different metrics to measure object localization performance, it's difficult to compare reported results. Moreover, existing localization metrics do not quantitatively measure localization performance of multiple object instances in images.

In this work we propose a multiple-instance object localization evaluation protocol. This protocol enhances existing metrics to take into account localization of multiple object instances in images. Our method relies on the standard classification task and requires no additional modifications to networks or CAM-based localization methods.

Using our multiple-instance object localization evaluation protocol for CAM-based methods, we observe that localization performance of evaluated CAM-based methods decreases as more object instances are present in images. This way we demonstrate that our metrics quantitatively capture multiple-instance localization performance for images with multiple object instances of the same class. We use the evaluated CAM-based methods and network models as baseline for further localization performance improvements.

To improve multiple-instance localization performance, we introduce an iterative localization method, where we use localization information of object locations predicted during previous iterations, to mask already found object instances in the original image, and to subsequently find the location of additional object instances not found during earlier iterations. We demonstrate that, using an appropriate merge strategy for combining localization information of multiple iterations, localization recall can be improved, but often at the cost of decreased precision when compared with non-iterative localization.
