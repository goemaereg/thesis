\begin{verbatim}
Positioning of WSOL in object localization landscape (versus object detection).
We focus on WSOL CAM method: explain what it is and its limitations.
WSOL research focus on overcoming limitations.
Problem is that WSOL is not tested for detecting multiple object instances.

We introduce evaluation protocol for multiple-instance WSOL by defining new metrics. 
We benchmark existing CAM methods for multi-instance WSOL.
We define improvement for multiple-instance WSOL.
