\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{verbatim}
General approach:

Explain all terms: E.g. WSOL.
Introduce topics
Explain choices
- Why specific datasets, architectures, annotations, masks?
- Why first with synthetic dataset?

Positioning of WSOL in object localization landscape.
WHy WSOL? 
Advantage over object detection: no costly human labeling of every object in images.
Therefore, WSOL gained significant momentum 
We focus on WSOL CAM method: explain what it is

Explain aim of localization: cover full extent of object
<-> CAM focuses on discriminative parts of object which is limitation
WSOL CAM research focus on overcoming limitations. Give references to papers and shortly describe vairous techniques (Gradcam, Gradcam++, ScoreCAM, MinMaxCAM, NL-CAM)

Indicate that certain techniques mainly used for explainability, are better in detecting multiple objects from the same class in an image: E.g. ScoreCAM shows promise in qualitative experiment results.

Most CAM methods reported performance improvements over baseline CAM method. Due to lack of unified definition of WSOL task, WSOL evaluation paper criticizes the methods and proposes a new evaluation protocol localization. 

A problem is that WSOL is not tested for detecting multiple object instances and current WSOL metrics are not sufficient to measure multiple instance localization.

Our contribution:

We introduce evaluation protocol for multiple-instance WSOL by defining new metrics. 
We benchmark existing CAM methods for multi-instance WSOL.
We define improvement for multiple-instance WSOL.
