% Feedback van Benjamin:
introductie\\
- Wat is wSOL, waarom gebruiken, advandage over object detection\\
- doel object localization\\
- waarom de keuzes van de metodologie\\
verschil wsol en explanation\\
beschrijven cam methods is eerder related work. Zeggen dat cam familie metode is voor localizatie en verwijzen naar related work.\\
hier research question in intro zetten en niet in related work.\\

General approach:
\\\\
Explain all terms: E.g. WSOL.
\\
Introduce topics and explain choices:\\
- Why specific datasets, architectures, annotations, masks?\\
- Why first with synthetic dataset?\\
\\
Positioning of WSOL in object localization landscape.
\\
WHy WSOL? \\ 
Advantage over object detection: no costly human labeling of every object in images.\\
Therefore, WSOL gained significant momentum. \\
We focus on WSOL CAM method: explain what it is. \\
\\
Explain aim of localization: cover full extent of object \\
In contrast: CAM focuses on discriminative parts of object which is limitation. \\
WSOL CAM research focus on overcoming limitations. Give references to papers and shortly describe various techniques (CAM, Gradcam, Gradcam++, ScoreCAM, MinMaxCAM. \\
\\
Indicate that certain techniques mainly used for explainability, are better in detecting multiple objects from the same class in an image: E.g. ScoreCAM shows promise in qualitative experiment results.\\
\\
Most CAM methods reported performance improvements over baseline CAM method. Due to lack of unified definition of WSOL task, WSOL evaluation paper criticizes the methods and proposes a new evaluation protocol localization. \\
\\
A problem is that WSOL is not tested for detecting multiple object instances and current WSOL metrics are not sufficient to measure multiple instance localization.\\
\\
Our contribution:
\\
We introduce evaluation protocol for multiple-instance WSOL by defining new metrics. \\
We benchmark existing CAM methods for multi-instance WSOL.\\
We define improvement for multiple-instance WSOL.\\
